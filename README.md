<h1 align="center"> Floaty </h1>

<p align="center"> Solution for all the web designers who need to support the older browsers. </p>

<hr/>

<p> Floaty is 0,6 Kb(0,35 Kb gzip) CSS layout solution with basic responsive layout and will work even in the older browsers. </p>

<p>
I made 5 CSS layout solutions based on Flex and CSS GRID (<a href="https://github.com/vladocar/SMART-CSS-GRID">SMART CSS GRID</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vladocar/60gs">60 GS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vladocar/flexy">Flexy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vladocar/Katana">Katana</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vladocar/Flex-One">Flex One</a>)  this year and most common question is: will it work in IE.  
The answers is: not always.</a>
</p>

<p>Floats were never meant to be used as layout solution but I think still 90% of all the web uses floats probably of the simplicity, fear of browser un-compatibility and web designers / developers need to learn more complex layout systems like Flex or CSS Grid.</p>

<p>With floats you can go left or right, anyone can learn that.</p>

<p>Flex and CSS Grid are first real layout solutions and if possible we should always push the web forward.</p>

<p>But if for some reason you still want to "go with the float", this solution may help you. </p>
